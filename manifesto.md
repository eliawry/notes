Towards a place for making beautiful things with friends

Once we were brave, now we're bored. We came here from all kinds of places. We're alienated from our destinites.
We are children with high incomes and no destinies. All day we touch plastic glass and brushed steel. We have the 1980s office building nightmare in our pockets. Nothing is sublime except our text - an empty claim. We have friends everywhere we watch on FaceBook. We're a living Brave New World.

We go to yoga class and the rock climbing gym. touching more plastic. the world has been cast to fit us like a glove.

seriously, when was the last time you touched something that wasn't plastic and wasn't bought? i hope you have someone to hold. because that's the only way.

we're getting older every year. we know we're bougie and we stopped caring if we ever did.

as children, we were vessels for some unwritten promise; we were shining and brilliant and magnet. or hell maybe we were the black sheep. we all have our scars. but we're very smart now. very clever.

fingers fly across black chicklets. we drink but not to forget because anymore what is there to forget?

we live in a materialistic utopia. blue skies. pretty faces. 4g. weatherfree and invisible poverty. and pain is more or less optional. easier to opt out of emotion.

why are we alienated? we are very clever and can convince ourselves each new shining idea will change the world. we're supposed to be positive dynamos of starry light and we can convince ourselves of anything. lean in. say yes. ship it. do it. disrupt.

maybe we can fix this with algorithms. we've found such solace in our medication - we are almost all clinically depressed, after all.

automate and consume. what's the end goal - to no longer have to exist? frantically creating apis for each other all day long. fetch this, get that, do something else. go here, pay there. fricionless. apps are some strange lubrication to slip the flawless future in without us hardly noticing; it's more convenient.

do you ever think back on what it was like to think? do you remember what it was like to feel?

come live with me in the woods, please. we're going to make something real and beautiful out there. we'll share ideas. we'll play in the sun and swim and return to a time of innocence. we'll watch sunsets and sleep in and hug and bake cupcakes and stirfry. we'll have petty fights about dishes and resolve them with games of pogs or via voting.

no one will have to work very hard but everyone sort of will, at something. do what you want as long as you don't hurt anyone. have jam sessions, work on puzzles, make fires. build robots to irrigate the crops. work on something you believe in. make things when you feel moved to do so.

and it is about that, mostly, for some of us. and for others it's mostly about sitting quietly all day and thinking about music theory, until you need to take a break, then you can milk a goat.

this is the lottery ticket silicon valley promised you when you moved in. if you scratch that ticket will you have any deeper experince than this?

on the weekends, we'll have barnraisings and hackathons. we'll make robots to make mug cake mix and our own soylent optimized for each of us. we'll go camping and climbing and biking. maybe someday someone will have a kid, and that's cool too.

i want to have impact, and a lot of us will. we're all on a hero's journey. you have your own life and quest and you'll be with us and then you'll be gone. if you want to keep working at your job, all the better. that's my plan. i want to make the entire world a better place, i just want to be human while i do it. how can you hing you love with the peopleknow if you're truly making the world better when you can't even see it?

perhaps we need some sort of meaning in our play. not that coming to the woods will give you that, but it will gave you the space you need for your interactions and actons to mean something. this is a woods for people who need to create and who want to touch the earth.

we've been promised so many things about the future. "maybe postmodernism's just an extended tantrum about how we don't have our flying cars yet". this is the future and we don't *need* to work so hard. but working in capitalism leads to needs, and the needs lead to work, and then there is no time left.

let's make a place for the humane treatment of thought. let's make a place where we can embody our cognition. let's make a place where we won't have to tiptoe around the terrifingly content, bored eyes of google engineers, hoping to avoid the mirrors that lie within because you're afraid of seeing your own future. this is how to stop being afraid.

and i mean, we'll still buy stuff. this is the future, the gift our ancestors worked for so long to give us. life used to be nasty, brutish, short. and we're all on the way to a sudden stop, the big drop. take advantage of the economies of scale, and buy some cheese when we need it. together we *can* figure out how to get everyone to fifteen hours of work. if we want. i mean, you don't have to want. wasn't it wanting that got us in this whole mess? yeah, don't worry, you don't have to want anything. though you can.

life is poem and the vocabulary is dances and actions. and these actions signify something. write a beautiful poem on your journey. make sure your symbols are beautiful.

do you not need to connect with the mystery that you are?

"a company is just a way of helping people organize the stuff they want to do together"
don't you believe that? find something you love, something you want to do, something you want to create. organize yourselves around the the thing you love with the people you love. we're not serving ourselves, but we are the sum of our connections and we're serving our own journeys, but our journey is also to serve others. it's time to leave eden. leaving eden is what it is to be human. taste of the fruit of the tree.

i think i'm making all of this sound way trippier than it is. I'm sane! I'm a silicon valley person just like you. I'm a data scientist in a company big enough to have a few layers of middle management. sometimes i look at how designers at my startup paint their nails and emulate them. i get invited to google for sushi. i boulder v2-v3 at planet granite with mit grads who wear lead badgers. my kickstarter profile is dope. I have a Galaxy S6 with Google Opinior Rewards installed. I consume. I get it. I majored in computer science with a 4.0 GPA. and i loved every minute of it! I know the Twilio API and I made a site once called wispr.ly with sounds for every spot on a google map. i made an academic paper manager in ruby on rails. i sip expensive cocktails and sometimes listen to mumford and sons. I hope in the woods my GitHub yearly contribution report is green every day. I have VERY STRONG opinions about Javascript and Python. I'm working my way through SICP. I'm AGGRESSIVELY sane. so trust me.

trust me when I say you're missing this, and you need it. you only get to live once, so choose to live well. form your own narrative. find peace and meaning in the woods.
